#PostgreSQL Database Diff Checker using C# .NET Core with an MVC architecture. 

#The solution consists of:
##Core Logic Layer - Contains the domain models and services for database operations
##Web Application - MVC interface with intuitive color-coded results

#Key Features
##1. Database Connection
Users can enter source and target database connection strings with descriptive names
Connection form provides examples of PostgreSQL connection strings
Light green and light red UI differentiation for source and target databases

##2. Schema Comparison
Detects missing or newly added schemas between databases
Shows schema ownership differences

##3. Table Comparison
Lists tables that exist in one database but not the other
Organizes tables by schema for better clarity

##4. Column Comparison
Compares column properties:
- Names
- Data types
- Nullable constraints
- Default values
- Comments

##5. Constraint Comparison
Compares primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints
Shows the full constraint definition for easy analysis

##6. Index Comparison
Compares database indexes between schemas
Shows the full index definition

##7. Visual Presentation
Color-coded differences:
- Green for newly added items
- Red for missing items
- Yellow for modified items

##Technical Implementation:
Database Access: Uses Npgsql library to connect to PostgreSQL databases
Query System: Utilizes PostgreSQL system catalogs and information_schema
Comparison Engine: Custom logic to detect additions, removals, and modifications
Responsive UI: Bootstrap-based interface with proper color accessibility

##Future Extensibility
The solution is designed to easily accommodate your future requirements:

##Views comparison
Permissions comparison
Function/procedure source code comparison

These can be added by implementing additional queries in the PostgreSqlDatabaseService and updating the UI to display the differences.
